									<h2>Jayden Watkins</h2>
									<p>Born in Central Queensland, Australia. Have studied Education/Engineering at university
										in the past but didn’t end up enjoying them enough to continue them. I speak some Japanese
										at a basic level from high school studies as well as some post-high school self-study.
										My main hobbies are music, photography (@f.fly.photography) and building GunPla (@yojiflea_builds).</p>

									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									<p>I’ve been interested in computers and IT since I was a child. Like most kids, my interest in
										computers comes from playing the basic games like Space Cadet Pinball on my parents Windows XP
										prebuilt system. This then expanded in high school where I took every IT elective I could
										throughout my five years there (ICT in junior and IPT and ITS in senior). Around this time,
										I started to dabble in building computers and since then have built all my own, as well
										as my friends, computers. </p>

									<h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
									<p>I chose to study at RMIT after chatting to a friend who was currently studying the Bachelor
										of IT there. After a bit of questioning, I thought I’d try it as well as he spoke highly of
										the course, and I was trying to think of something to go back to university for after two
										unsuccessful attempts. I'm personally looking forward to coding experience, more hardware
										related comp sci units to learn, how the modern work environment in IT functions and how to
										best apply myself in said environment and most importantly, being able to work in teams to produce
										fantastic projects that I can use in a portfolio for post-graduation.</p>

							<h2>Ideal IT Job</h2>
							<p>The position of this job is a <b>Software Engineer</b> for Games Development with the company Scientific Games. As someone who has
								been into video games since I was old enough to remember, the idea of being able to possibly create some of the future video
								games that people love and enjoy is extremely appealing to me. Working in a team of likeminded individuals who also seek the
								same outcome also feels like it would create an enjoyable work environment that would make you excited to go to work.</p>

						 			 <a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/idealjob.jpg" alt="" data-position="top center" /></a><br /><br />
									 <h3>Current Skills, Qualifications and Plans for the Future</h3>
									 <p>I currently have partial completion of a degree (technically), a passion for making video games, some experience with time
									 constraints as well as some experience with developing in Unity and by extension, some experience with the C based languages.
									 In order to obtain the skills required for a position like this, I would need to complete my degree through RMIT choosing
									 subjects that relate to software development (any based in C#/C++ would be very beneficial). As well as studying through
									 university, spending the time to learn Unity and practice developing small projects would be beneficial to show competency
									 in those required things. Having some experience through university as well as outside showing team work, time management
									 and relevant coding concepts would be helpful as well.</p>

											 	 A passion for making games<br /><br />
												 Being able to show competency with programming (build automation, continuous integration) as well as experience
												 with agile software methodologies (increment based)<br /><br />
