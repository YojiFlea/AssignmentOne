									<h2>Jayden Watkins</h2>
									<p>Born in Central Queensland, Australia. Have studied Education/Engineering at university
										in the past but didn’t end up enjoying them enough to continue them. I speak some Japanese
										at a basic level from high school studies as well as some post-high school self-study.
										My main hobbies are music, photography <a href="https://www.instagram.com/f.fly.photography/" target="_blank">(@f.fly.photography)</a>
										and building GunPla <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yojiflea_builds/" target ="_blank">(@yojiflea_builds)</a>.</p>

									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									<p>I’ve been interested in computers and IT since I was a child. Like most kids, my interest in
										computers comes from playing the basic games like Space Cadet Pinball on my parents Windows XP
										prebuilt system. This then expanded in high school where I took every IT elective I could
										throughout my five years there. Around this time, I started to dabble in building computers
										and since then have built all my own, as well as my friends, computers. </p>

									<h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
									<p>I chose to study at RMIT after chatting to a friend who was currently studying the Bachelor
										of IT there. After a bit of questioning, I thought I’d try it as well as he spoke highly of
										the course, and I was trying to think of something to go back to university for after two
										unsuccessful attempts. I'm personally looking forward to coding experience, more hardware
										related comp sci units to learn, how the modern work environment in IT functions and how to
										best apply myself in said environment and most importantly, being able to work in teams to produce
										fantastic projects that I can use in a portfolio for post-graduation.</p>

							<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
							<h3>Myer-Briggs (INFP-T: Mediator)</h3>
							<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/lildude.jpg" alt="" data-position="25% 25%" /></a>
							<p>According to the first of the three personality tests that I’ve taken, my Myers-Briggs results has
								indicated that I am an empathetic, creative, truth speaking individual searching for a place in the world.
								My learning style from the three primary learning styles according to EducationPlanner.org is that I mainly
								learn via an auditory style. For my final personality quiz, I chose MindTools “How Creative Are You?”
								test and was considered a “work in progress creative”. This hints that I’ve had some success in the past
								and need to use this success to propel myself forward in the future with more creative endeavours.</p>
							<p>When it comes to team behaviour, I believe that my personality allows me to work well within teams due to my
								empathetic nature, as well my tendency to be a generous person when it comes to teamwork. I’m also open-minded
								and accepting which means I would be less likely to clash with other members of the team, as well as being a
								positive confidant for anyone. I feel like my creativity would be a detractor, as I can sometimes find it hard
								to come up with great ideas in a timely manner. However, I am comfortable with the idea of brainstorming ideas
								with my team to assist in forming strong ideas as a foundation for any projects.</p>
								<p>When forming a team, I believe it’s important to find other members who share similar positive traits such as empathy,
									openness and being open-minded. But, have a variety of people with different creative traits as this tends to lead to
									having more ideas in the brainstorming phase of the project and overall leads to a more positive outcome. Also, as
									someone who is comfortable mediating possible problems between members, I feel I would be able to keep conflicts
									in any group to a minimum in order to stop tensions from growing and dislike forming between other members.</p>

							<h2>Ideal IT Job</h2>
							<p>The position of this job is a <b>Software Engineer</b> for Games Development with the company Scientific Games. As someone who has
								been into video games since I was old enough to remember, the idea of being able to possibly create some of the future video
								games that people love and enjoy is extremely appealing to me. Working in a team of likeminded individuals who also seek the
								same outcome also feels like it would create an enjoyable work environment that would make you excited to go to work.</p>

									 <h3>Current Skills, Qualifications and Plans for the Future</h3>
									 <p>I currently have partial completion of a degree (technically), a passion for making video games, some experience with time
									 constraints as well as some experience with developing in Unity and by extension, some experience with the C based languages.
									 In order to obtain the skills required for a position like this, I would need to complete my degree through RMIT choosing
									 subjects that relate to software development (any based in C#/C++ would be very beneficial). As well as studying through
									 university, spending the time to learn Unity and practice developing small projects would be beneficial to show competency
									 in those required things. Having some experience through university as well as outside showing team work, time management
									 and relevant coding concepts would be helpful as well.</p>

							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
							 <h3>Overview</h3>
								 <p>My IT project that I’ve chosen to undertake is to create a service where users can order replacement 3D printed parts for Bandai
									 Gundam model kits. Users will be able to find the specific part they need from a website using the runner’s name and part number
									 associated with their kits and be able to order a 3D resin-printed replica of that part. Users will then have their part created
									 and posted to them. 3D resin parts would be used as they can convey more detail than other traditional 3D printing methods.</p>
								<h3>Motivation</h3>
									<p>Currently, if you lose or damage an individual part beyond repair you have very limited options in replacing said part. In Japan,
										here is a domestic service where you can buy replacement part runners for your model kit through a mail in form included in every
										instruction manual. If you live outside of Japan however, the options to replace an individual piece mean that you either must buy
										a whole new model kit or use a replacement parts provider such as “Gundam Replacement Parts” for a Japan-based exporter or “Mecha Parts Guy”
										for a US-based exporter. Both these services work by buying extra model kits and selling either full runners, or individual pieces with
										the relevant numbers. This sees a problem as due to the nature of production; multiple pieces are cast at once onto plastic runners using
										injection moulded plastic so individual parts are currently impossible to purchase. Fans of Bandai’s Gundam models are already using the
										easily available resin 3D printers to create custom parts, so this would create a genuine way to create replacement parts that cuts down
										on plastic waste.</p>
									<h3>Description</h3>
									 <p>My idea is to implement a partnership with Bandai in order to sell individually 3D resin printed pieces, made to order and selected through
										  a website in which users select the piece/s they need replaced. The user would visit the website looking to replace a part that was broken
											or lost, search for the model kit that the piece is from by either entering the kit number or looking up the name of the kit and filtering
											relevant results. From there, the user would be greeted by dropdown menu’s that would show each runner name and after selecting the relevant
											runner, would show a following dropdown menu that then displays all the pieces which they can select the one they are searching for.
											Once the user was finished with their decision, they could continue to enter payment information and then shipping details and once processed,
											create an order for a replacement part.<br />
											The other side of this project would be the 3D printing process. A huge assumption of this project is that a partnership is formed with Bandai,
											as Gundam model kits are a trademarked entity and replicating these without permission could result in legal action from the owning parties.
											The CAD files that are used to design the individual parts would be shared converted into STL files to ready for 3D printing. When a user orders
											a particular replacement part, the relevant replacement part will be printed using the STL files from before on a small to mid-grade resin
											3D printer. Multiple parts from different orders could be printed at once in order to reduce costs. After the parts are finished and cleaned
											up, they would be shipped to them via a courier or postal service, completing the order and helping the user finish their model project.</p>
										<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
											<p>For website development, services like Shopify could be used to create a storefront with built in payment handling support. These services
												also handle site creation and development using HTML and CSS. For the creation side of the project, software like AutoCAD could be used to
												view/modify existing CAD designs, and export to STL for printing. For 3D printers, there isn’t necessarily a need to use high end printers
												as the Gundam pieces are generally made from basic plastics (polystyrene, acrylic and ABS), so smaller hobby machines could be used originally
												and scaled up depending on the demand.</p>
										<h3>Skills Required</h3>
											<p>General website development knowledge would be important (HTML, CSS etc for front-end development and Ruby, Python, PHP etc to handle databasing
												of all the thousands of parts). Basic AutoCAD knowledge would be essential for handling the file conversions. But some design knowledge would be
												beneficial in case modifications needed to be made to the 3D models. Experience with 3D printers is another must-have although most entry-level
												and even some commercial grade 3D printers are quite beginner friendly, so this is less important than the above. Most of the skills above besides
												website development can be taught quickly to even the most beginning learners of this. For website development however, some moderate HTML and CSS
												knowledge would be required and the backend languages would need some more extensive knowledge in, especially for handling data in large volumes.</p>
										<h3>Outcome</h3>
											<p>If the project was successful, Gundam model builders all over wouldn’t have to worry about losing or destroying pieces and having to pay
												upwards of $450 for a brand-new model kit because they lost a single piece. When beginner model kits can begin at $20, it doesn’t seem
												like much of a problem to replace parts. However, with some of the high-end kits costing $450 and up it starts to become a huge problem
												for hobbyists. Another issue that this would help alleviate would be plastic reduction. As mentioned above in the production of plastic
												runners, to replace a single part would mean a whole new runner would have to be used to replace the part. This means the remaining plastic
												would go to waste as there are no non-Japanese Bandai plastic recycling options, which is a huge issue in modern society.</p>
